- **SonarQube** - Code quality and security analysis
- **Safety** - Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
- **OWASP ZAP** - Web application security testing
- **Container scanning** with Trivy
- **Runtime security monitoring**

### Infrastructure Security
- **Kubernetes security policies**
- **Network segmentation**
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
- **Secret management**

### CI/CD Security
- **Signed commits** verification
- **Pipeline security scanning**
- **Artifact integrity validation**
- **Secure deployment practices**

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Code Review** - All code must be reviewed by at least one maintainer
2. **Security Testing** - Run security scans before submitting PRs
3. **Dependency Updates** - Keep dependencies up to date
4. **Secrets Management** - Never commit secrets or credentials
5. **Signed Commits** - Use GPG-signed commits when possible

### For Deployments

1. **Least Privilege** - Run containers with minimal required permissions
2. **Network Security** - Implement proper network policies
3. **Monitoring** - Enable comprehensive security monitoring
4. **Backup Strategy** - Maintain secure backup procedures
5. **Incident Response** - Have a clear incident response plan

## 📋 Security Checklist

Before deploying this pipeline in production:

- [ ] Review and customize security policies
- [ ] Configure security scanning tools
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Implement proper access controls
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Create incident response procedures
- [ ] Regular security assessments
- [ ] Staff security training

## 🔍 Known Security Considerations

### Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates through automated scanning
- Vulnerability database monitoring
- License compliance checking

### Container Security
- Multi-stage builds for minimal attack surface
- Non-root user execution
- Resource limitations
- Security context configuration

### Data Protection
- Encryption in transit and at rest
- Secure secret management
- Data minimization principles
- Privacy by design

## 📊 Security Metrics

We track the following security metrics:

- **Mean Time to Patch** (MTTP): < 24 hours for critical vulnerabilities
- **Security Scan Coverage**: 100% of code and dependencies
- **False Positive Rate**: < 5% for security alerts
- **Security Test Coverage**: > 80% of security controls
